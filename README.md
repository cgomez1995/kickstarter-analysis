# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. The data used to showcase for Louise was the Kickstarter dataset. The dataset includes a wide range of campaigns in various genres from television to plays and shows the campaigned goals and pledges.  For the review, Louise was interested in plays. I used the Kickstarter dataset to understand through visualizations the outcomes of the campaigns based on their launch dates and the funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
Louise was interested in understanding the outcome of other plays based on their launch date and funding goals. Once the data set was appropriately named and saved, the next step was to clean the data. To only observe the outcomes based on launch date I generated a pivot table and line chart to visualize the data. The date created conversion column of the kickstarted dataset was broken down into years with a formula, and this information along with the outcome category was turned into a pivot table, and later a line chart. The line chart below visualizes the analysis of outcomes based on launch date for successful, failed, and canceled campaigns.

The data lets us know that most successful campaigns launched in May, and as the year progress the launched campaigns are not as successful. This information is important for Louise because future campaigns can be launched in late April and early May to have the most success at becoming funded. The second part of the analysis was understanding the outcomes based on goals. Here I wanted to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. A challenge of this task is to manipulate the formula in the spreadsheet to fit within the parameters for the goal column. It took a few tries to understand how to tailor the formula for Excel to understand. In the end, the finished product is the Outcomes Based on Goal chart below, with the with the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis, the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis.

Most of the challenges and difficulties I encountered came from understanding how to communicate with Excel. Two conclusions I can draw about the outcomes based on launch date are that successful campaigns are more likely to start in May, and that campaigns started in December has close to similar chances of success and failure. Centered on the outcomes based on goals chart I can say that the successful campaigns have a lower monetary goal value, meaning that campaigns with goals less than $1000 were close to 80 percent successful at achieving that goal. The data is good about showing what the sample provides, thus Louise can only infer from the information based on what is provided for the set number of dates and locations. Because the data is time sensitive, it can be difficult to determine how future campaigns will react, since the world economy might be different in the future than it was in the past when a certain campaign was started. Additionally, different cultural appeals change overtime, and a similar campaign might no longer be favorable by a future generation. Other tables or graphs that can be created can include a bar chart to showcase the total percentage of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes. A histogram is also good to see if the dataset is symmetrical, or to see in which direction the data would skew.
